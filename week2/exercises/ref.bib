  abstract = {This paper begins with a brief description of a theoretical framework
	for semantic memory, in which processing is inherently sensitive
	to the varying typicality of its representations. The approach is
	then elaborated with particular regard to evidence from semantic
	dementia, a disorder resulting in relatively selective deterioration
	of conceptual knowledge, in which cognitive performance reveals ubiquitous
	effects of typicality. This applies to frankly semantic tasks (like
	object naming), where typicality can be gauged by the extent to which
	an object or concept is characterized by shared features in its category.
	It also applies in tasks apparently requiring only access to a ‘surface’
	representation (such as lexical decision) or translation from one
	surface representation to another (like reading words aloud), where
	typicality is defined in terms of the structure of the surface domain(s).
	The effects of surface-domain typicality also appear early in the
	time course of word and object processing by normal participants,
	as revealed in event-related potential studies. These results suggest
	that perceptual and conceptual processing form an interactive continuum
	rather than distinct stages, and that typicality effects reign throughout
	this continuum.},

	presents the results of the Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP)
	group's work in the early 1980s and provides a good overview of the
	earlier neural network research. The PDP approach (also known as
	connectionism among other things) is based on the conviction that
	various aspects of cognitive activity are thought of in terms of
	massively parallel processing. The first volume starts with the general
	framework and continues with an analysis of learning mechanisms and
	various mathematical and computational tools important in the analysis
	of neural networks. The chapter on backpropagation is written by
	Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams, who codiscovered the algorithm in
	1986. The second volume is written with a psychological and biological
	emphasis. It explores the relationship of PDP to various aspects
	of human cognition. The book is a comprehensive research survey of
	its time and most of the book's results and methods are still at
	the foundation of the neural network field.}},
