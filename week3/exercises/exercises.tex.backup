\section{Replicate the Model}
In order to replicate the model you must understand both the theory and the implementation details of the model.
Apart from training on the given patterns and evaluating its performance, which you are expected to do as part of this week's practical, it is important to be able to articulate what it is the model is and is not capturing.
So while you read through the paper make sure to think about more cognitive, methodological, and theoretical, questions --- some of these can only be answered when you have implemented your version of the model:
\begin{enumerate}


 \item What theory is this model part of?
 \item What assumptions does the theory make? 
 \item What assumptions does the model make? 
 \item Which implementation details are central to the model and which are not? 
 \item Which imprelemtation details are central to the theory and which are not? 
 \item Does the model uniquely support a theory? Do results from the model lend support only to one theory? 
 \item  What mechanism(s) is the model proposing?
 \item   What are the models predictions? 

\item Can the model account for data it has not seen?
