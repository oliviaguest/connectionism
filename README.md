##Installing Python 

###Windows Users

This is a little tricky:

1. Install Python: [download from here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.10/python-2.7.10.msi)

2. Install matplotlib, numpy, and scipy using pip. Specifically you need to download the following from [here](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/):
 - matplotlib-1.4.3-cp27-none-win32.whl
 - numpy-1.10.0b1+mkl-cp27-none-win32.whl
 - scipy-0.16.0-cp27-none-win32.whl
 
 This requires you to be in the Scripts folder of the Python27 installation. And to use the windows command prompt. For me this looks like:
```
C:\Python27\Scripts>pip install NAME_OF_WHEEL_FILE.whl
```
For all three of those you need to run a pip command like above.  

3. Install PyGTK: [download from here](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygtk/2.24/pygtk-all-in-one-2.24.2.win32-py2.7.msi)

4. To check that everything works, open network.py and see if it runs without any errors.

###Mac Users

I have a Mac and I still have no idea how to get PyGTK to work on it. If you know, please [tell me](mailto:olivia@oliviaguest.com). I have gone the lazy route and run PyGTK code off the server over ssh. 

###Linux Users

You know what to do.
